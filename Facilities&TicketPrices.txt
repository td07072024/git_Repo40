The Disneyland Resort includes two theme parks, three hotels owned by Disney, along with a shopping, dining and entertainment complex.

Theme parks
Disneyland, the company’s first theme park and the only built by Walt Disney, which opened on July 17, 1955.
Disney California Adventure, a theme park based on Disney's interpretation of California, which opened on February 8, 2001.
Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment
Downtown Disney, a 15-acre (6.1 ha) outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment district with approximately 30 venues, mostly operated by third parties that pay rent to Disney.
Hotels
The Disneyland Resort includes three company owned and operated hotels with approximately 2,400 rooms, 180 Disney Vacation Club villas, and 180,000 square feet (17,000 m2) of conference meeting space.

Disneyland Hotel, the resort's original hotel built by Jack Wrather which opened on October 5, 1955, and was purchased by Disney in 1988.
Pixar Place Hotel, a hotel themed to artwork created by Pixar Animation Studios. Opened in 1984 as the Emerald of Anaheim, operated by the Tokyu Group and later named The Pan Pacific Hotel Anaheim,[26] the hotel was purchased by Disney in December 1995, for a reported US$36 million, and renamed the Disneyland Pacific Hotel.[27] As part of the 1998–2001 expansion of the resort, it was re-branded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel.[28] The lobby and convention/banquet facilities had undergone several renovations since the re-branding, most notably in 2004 and 2005. It officially reopened as Pixar Place Hotel on January 30, 2024.
Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, based on the Craftsman style of architecture of the early 1900s, which opened on January 2, 2001.
Ticket prices
Approximately 60,000 people visited the park on Disneyland's opening day, July 17, 1955,[29] when park admission was priced at $1 for adults and 50¢ for children. This did not include access to rides and other individual attractions; attraction tickets could be purchased separately for 10¢ to 35¢.[30] Single attraction tickets were permanently eliminated in June 1982;[30] access to all the park's attractions were included in the price of park admission.

Admission prices have greatly increased since the gates first opened, due in part to inflation, the continuing construction and renovation of attractions, and the addition of a second theme park, Disney California Adventure. As of January 17, 2020, one-day "Park Hopper" tickets, allowing entry to both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, are priced from $154 to $199 for adults, and from $148 to $191 for children.[31] Visitors can also purchase one-park tickets and multi-day tickets.

In addition to daily tickets, in 1984 an annual pass (called an "Annual Premium Passport") was introduced granting daily entry for a year at a time for $65 for adults and $49 for children. Currently annual passes (now called the "Magic Key") range in price from $399 to $1,339.
