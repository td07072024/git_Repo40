In April 2019, Disneyland announced that Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway would be coming to Disneyland in 2023. The attraction was built behind Mickey's Toontown in a former backstage area and opened on January 27, 2023.[18]

In January 2024, Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel officially reopened as Pixar Place Hotel.[19]

Future expansion and proposed DisneylandForward project
Disney announced plans to build a fourth hotel at the resort in 2016, slated for an opening in 2021.[20] In August 2018, the hotel was placed on hold indefinitely because of a dispute with the city of Anaheim.[21][22] The project was cancelled in October 2018 when the Anaheim City Council removed tax incentives.[23]

In March 2021, the Disney announced a new project for the resort called DisneylandForward. This proposal is designed to change the city of Anaheim's zoning rules so that Disney can build more theme park space for both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Proposals have included building more space where Pixar Place Hotel and the surrounding parking lots on the west-side of the resort currently reside. Rumors have surfaced that a new version of a mixed-use Disney Springs would be built near the Toy Story parking lot.[24] In May 2024, DisneylandFoward received final approval from the Anaheim City Council.[25]
