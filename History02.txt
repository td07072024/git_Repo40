1998–2001: planning an expansion
After Walt's and Roy's deaths in 1966 and 1971, respectively, the Walt Disney Company would go on to achieve success with the multi-park, multi-hotel resort complex business model of Walt Disney World in Florida, which opened in 1971. In the 1990s, Disney decided to turn Disneyland into a similar multi-park, multi-hotel resort destination. In 1991, Disney announced plans to build WestCOT, a theme park based on Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center, mostly on the site of the 15,167-space 100-acre (40 ha) parking lot.[5][6] Its estimated cost was US$3 billion, largely due to the cost of land that Disney would need to acquire.

However, the Euro Disney Resort, which opened in 1992, was a financial and public relations albatross for the company and Disney was unable to finance the WestCOT project, and it was cancelled in 1995. That summer, Disney executives gathered in Aspen, Colorado for a 3-day retreat, where they came up with the idea for a California-themed park, dubbed Disney's California Adventure Park, a retail district, and hotels. The budget for the project would be $1.4 billion, less than half of WestCOT, achieved by building a smaller theme park only on land Disney owned, focused on shopping and dining and using many off-the-shelf rides, avoiding costly research and development.[6] The parking lot closed on January 21, 1998 to make way for construction. To replace the lost spaces, Disney opened a seven-story, 10,250-space parking structure on July 24, 2000.[5]

California Adventure opened on February 8, 2001[7] and was widely panned by critics and early visitors,[8] leading to substantially less attendance than expected. One area of significant criticism was that the park was aimed at adults, rather than children and families.[9] Disney executives later acknowledged that the park offered less value to visitors, with one-third as many attractions and fewer characters than Disneyland, leaving many families to chose to visit the older park instead.[10]

2001–present: Disneyland Resort complex

Disney began to quickly make changes to California Adventure, adding A Bug's Land to appeal to families and the Tower of Terror thrill ride for older guests. In late 2007, the company began a multi-year, $1.1 billion redesign and expansion plan for California Adventure (against its initial $600 million cost to build).[11][12] The most drastic changes to the park included a complete overhaul of the main entrance, the construction of a new Cars Land and the addition of the World of Color nighttime show. Additionally, many of the park's off-the-shelf rides were either removed outright or re-themed to have more of a focus on Disney characters. Construction was completed in 2012.[13] The redesign and expansion of the park saw attendance rates increase dramatically.[14]

In August 2015, it was announced that Disneyland Park would receive a 14-acre Star Wars-themed land scheduled to open in 2019.[15] It opened on May 31, 2019. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is home of two attractions, Millennium Falcon – Smugglers Run, and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance.

In October 2017, Disney announced a new Pixar Pals parking structure for the resort, which includes a 6,500-space parking structure, and a new transportation hub, which opened in July 2019.[16]

In March 2018, it was announced that A Bug's Land would close in September 2018. It was replaced by Avengers Campus on June 4, 2021.[17]
